# learning_bioinformatic_tools
This is a repository to prototype tools that I need to learn to use for my projects. They will be separated by folder and describe their use and give examples for how to run with existing data.

Learning recan: 
    A tool Phil introduced to me for generating window aligner data in Python. 
    software repository: https://github.com/babinyurii/recan
Idea for this prototyping of software will be to attemt the program with a subset of CYP2D6 duplicon sequences. After getting sequence identiy window data, I will also prototype plotting in R.
